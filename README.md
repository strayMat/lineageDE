# R package : warpDE
Differential expressed genes between reconstructed cell lineages

### Installation

You have to install and load [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools). You can do this from [CRAN](cran.r-project.org). In a R console enter:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Then use the `install_github` function to install the package:
```r
install_github("strayMat/warpDE")
```

A [vignette](https://github.com/strayMat/warpDE/tree/master/vignettes) details the usual workflow for the detection of differential expressed genes in scRNA-Seq data.
